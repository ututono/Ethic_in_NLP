However, the fact that the English language needs some form of technical term to describe someone with special needs, and the fact that there will always be sadistic assholes who will appropriate that term to dehumanize others makes the censorship of a single word kind of a pointless endeavor.

With that said...Im sorry, but you need to realize that your friendship with this woman has changed irrevocably. You and your husband *absolutely must* go low- or no-contact with her, at least for a few months. The reason for this is two-fold. First, you will give her time to ease up on this crush. Second, you will de-escalate the situation by sending a CLEAR message that you & husband are on the same page and that neither of you are interested in her and husband having any sort of improper relationship.   I also want to point out this comment from your post:  > I dont feel like I can set boundaries without getting pushback from my friend; she admits that a part of her would feel defiant of any rule that I or her husband tried to set, but that she might be able to accept a rule set by my husband, who is now in the position of trying to make it clear to her that hes not interested while still preserving a friendship and possibly creative partnership.   Just...really think about this for a second. Is she really your friend here? At all, not just in a best friend sense? Right here, you explicitly say that you dont feel comfortable setting healthy boundaries with her. You say that she *told you to your face* that she will **explicitly disrespect any boundaries YOU set, but not your husband -- thus making the situation about her & your husband, and cutting you out.** This is incredibly manipulative and messed up. She is not being adult about this. Her confession was about her trying to manipulate the situation to sow a seed of potentially ending up with your husband. If she was a good friend, she would have distanced herself and pushed herself to get over this crush.  I CANNOT emphasize this enough. This ENTIRE situation was deliberately engineered by your so-called friend to try and position herself between you and your husband, to exacerbate the difficult situations in your marriage, and to try to manipulate herself into the position of other woman. If you continue to interact with her in the same manner as before, **she will continue to try to ruin your marriage in a manipulative, underhanded manner**. You CANNOT trust her with the details of your relationship, or to be around your husband.  IMO, the right thing to do here is for YOU to message her and say, We [you & husband] need some time to process this.

Im so sorry, I never would have done that sober, (etc., etc.).

She started screaming that I dont trust her and I cant invade her privacy like that and if I cant trust her, we cant be together. At that point I said, I dont trust you right now. and started to get up.

She didnt have feelings for Stacy. She cheated on me a month ago with a guy from work that Ive never heard of, texted Stacy, Stacy told her to tell me, she responded that I would break up with her. About three weeks ago she started concocting a plan and trying to rope Stacy into it which Stacy eventually agreed to. She was going to get really drunk and she and Stacy were going to try to seduce me into a threesome and the next morning she would lambast me for fucking her best friend while she was drunk because our rule was that if we wanted to get somebody else involved in our sex life, we had to talk about it. After which, she would forgive me, say she messed up too and fucked the dude from work, and that we can work through it. And I said literally the only thing that was on my mind which was, Holy fuck, youre insane!

To which I reply, and I swear to God this is exactly how I said it, Haha! Nope! And shout, Will somebody get the fuck up here!. Steve and Debbie came up (I think everybody else was outside and they were waiting nearby). I told them Amanda hit Stacy, keep them apart and dont leave either one alone.
