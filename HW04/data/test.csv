People with special needs hear the word retard and it makes them feel like less of a person--for indeed, thats how people treat them. Most people act as if they cant understand, but they do.   The problem is that people use the term as a technical term (as I do here), as a dismissive/hateful term, and as a casual term. You describe the casual aspect--used apathetically. However, the fact that the English language needs some form of technical term to describe someone with special needs, and the fact that there will always be sadistic assholes who will appropriate that term to dehumanize others makes the censorship of a single word kind of a pointless endeavor. As I said before, there will always be a new word as long as the technical is tied with the hateful and the casual.

For example, I think that a fair compromise would be to say that he needs to contribute to chores equally, contribute to utilities equally, and you all need to figure out a shower schedule.

With that said...Im sorry, but you need to realize that your friendship with this woman has changed irrevocably. You and your husband *absolutely must* go low- or no-contact with her, at least for a few months. The reason for this is two-fold. First, you will give her time to ease up on this crush. Second, you will de-escalate the situation by sending a CLEAR message that you & husband are on the same page and that neither of you are interested in her and husband having any sort of improper relationship.   I also want to point out this comment from your post:  > I dont feel like I can set boundaries without getting pushback from my friend; she admits that a part of her would feel defiant of any rule that I or her husband tried to set, but that she might be able to accept a rule set by my husband, who is now in the position of trying to make it clear to her that hes not interested while still preserving a friendship and possibly creative partnership.   Just...really think about this for a second. Is she really your friend here? At all, not just in a best friend sense? Right here, you explicitly say that you dont feel comfortable setting healthy boundaries with her. You say that she *told you to your face* that she will **explicitly disrespect any boundaries YOU set, but not your husband -- thus making the situation about her & your husband, and cutting you out.** This is incredibly manipulative and messed up. She is not being adult about this. Her confession was about her trying to manipulate the situation to sow a seed of potentially ending up with your husband. If she was a good friend, she would have distanced herself and pushed herself to get over this crush.  I CANNOT emphasize this enough. This ENTIRE situation was deliberately engineered by your so-called friend to try and position herself between you and your husband, to exacerbate the difficult situations in your marriage, and to try to manipulate herself into the position of other woman. If you continue to interact with her in the same manner as before, **she will continue to try to ruin your marriage in a manipulative, underhanded manner**. You CANNOT trust her with the details of your relationship, or to be around your husband.  IMO, the right thing to do here is for YOU to message her and say, We [you & husband] need some time to process this. Were not sure we can ever feel comfortable being friends with you and [her husband] the way we were before. Please respect our wishes and refrain from contacting us until we are ready.   Then block her everywhere (EVERYWHERE. FB, email, phone, snapchat, etc) and give you and your husband time to work on your marriage WITHOUT HER INTERFERENCE. This should be the #1 priority for you.

Her daughters choose her and their relationship with their father was damaged, and you choose to be neutral and also choose in several instances to prioritise your fathers feelings over hers and that made you less close with your mum. Your relationship with both your parents was different for all of you because of your actions. Both your parents wills reflect that.  Its just as easy to think of her will as your mums attempt to care for the children that was rejected by the man who betrayed her and let the son who he favors rely soley on the support he has from instead of a punishment. Your interpretation makes you out to be so unfairly done by it will only leave you bitter. Why not go for a positive interpretation instead?  Also, your dad cutting his daughters out of his will and telling then about it for adandoning him, as you put it, is a punishment. Your mum deciding that one daugher gets half her mothers inheritance, other daughter also gets half her mothers inheritance, and son gets his fathers full inheritance can be interpreted so many different ways than punishment. You are hurt and its making you see people hurting you even when they arnt.

This...is one of them, from Californias tobacco control programs help line, which OVERALL is called No Butts.

She woke up a little before I did and left a bunch of texts and voicemails. I grabbed some breakfast at the hotel, read the comments on the previous post, went over. Im still very torn on how I handled everything; probably should have just broken up with her because, going over there, I wasnt thinking about her as a viable partner or even as an adult. Debbie let me in, showed me to the room that Amanda was in and left without saying anything (shes usually talkative; seemed like a bad sign). I didnt bother to ask where anybody else was, didnt really care at the moment.  > She started crying as soon as she saw me and kept crying very loudly from start to finish. At this point the numbness had set in again. I sort of stuck to the revised gameplan but read some comments from the previous post that made me think winging it would be better. After I told her how hurt and betrayed I felt she started saying that she took an anti-anxiety pill when she started drinking (turns out she drugged herself so now I feel like an asshole for not seeing that) and that she only thought it would make her kind of fucked up, that her memories were fuzzy but she didnt black out and didnt fuck anybody. Im so sorry, I never would have done that sober, (etc., etc.). I skipped over the drinking thing because that seemed like it was going to be more of an issue for therapy and saying You cant drink anymore felt like something I would say to a child more than a partner. I started with, I dont want you to have any more contact with Stacy. The two of you cheated, thats not okay. You cant make me stop seeing her. And I cant be with you if you keep seeing the person you cheated with. After that went on for 2-3 minutes she relented and I asked to see her phone so that I could look at recent texts to make sure this wasnt an ongoing affair. We have an open door policy on technology, we know each others passwords, she didnt seem to care about removing Stacy from her phone until I said I wanted to read their messages which made her freak the fuck out. She started screaming that I dont trust her and I cant invade her privacy like that and if I cant trust her, we cant be together. At that point I said, I dont trust you right now. and started to get up. She grabbed me and started crying even more, handed me her phone, and just stared at her feet.  > Remember how I said I have a type, turns out that type is assholes. She didnt have feelings for Stacy. She cheated on me a month ago with a guy from work that Ive never heard of, texted Stacy, Stacy told her to tell me, she responded that I would break up with her. About three weeks ago she started concocting a plan and trying to rope Stacy into it which Stacy eventually agreed to. She was going to get really drunk and she and Stacy were going to try to seduce me into a threesome and the next morning she would lambast me for fucking her best friend while she was drunk because our rule was that if we wanted to get somebody else involved in our sex life, we had to talk about it. After which, she would forgive me, say she messed up too and fucked the dude from work, and that we can work through it. And I said literally the only thing that was on my mind which was, Holy fuck, youre insane! And she started crying again and I could kind of make out that she said she was trying to fix our relationship and she wanted to make it right. How the fuck an actuary came up with this plan is beyond me. At this point I was fuming and I was starting to want to say hurtful things so I just got up and left, the relationship was unsalvageable at this point.  > Stacy was waiting in the hall and just looks ashamed. Amanda runs up to her and says, You promised me this one thing! and slaps her in the face audibly. I turned around, Stacys crouched on the ground now crying with her hands over her head whimpering, Thats not fair.. Im a quiet guy and I have never raised my voice with Amanda but I was raised by a marine so I know how to get loud when I want to. I shout, Get the fuck off of her! and it put the fear of God in her and she jumped back and stared at me and then started crying again and yelling at Stacy saying, You just had to do this one thing and everything would have been fine. To which I reply, and I swear to God this is exactly how I said it, Haha! Nope! And shout, Will somebody get the fuck up here!. Steve and Debbie came up (I think everybody else was outside and they were waiting nearby). I told them Amanda hit Stacy, keep them apart and dont leave either one alone. I grabbed some stuff I left at the house, called the cops on my way out, texted Adam that Stacy and Amanda plotted to rope me into a guilt threesome, and left; not staying around to watch that shit play out. I also called her brother and her mom to let them know we were breaking up and they should get in contact ASAP to make sure she doesnt hurt herself.  > TL;DR: She cheated on me a month ago, tried to get me to have a threesome with her and Stacy while she was drunk so she could guilt me into forgiving her, Stacy backed out, Amanda go too wasted, tried to keep the plan going, and cheated a second time.
